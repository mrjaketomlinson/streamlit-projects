# Streamlit Projects

In an attempt to learn how I can utilize streamlit for my own projects in the future, I started following a [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM) on the subject. Here's a breakdown of the projects.

## simple_stock_price

This simple application takes no input from the user, but gets your feet wet with grabbing a stock price using **yfinance** and displaying some data on the stock.

## simple_bioinformatics

This app takes a DNA sequence (string, editable by the end user), and displays the nucleotide breakdown in 4 different ways.

## eda_basketball

This app scrapes [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com) for information on basketball players in different teams. The app also allows the end user to select which teams(s) they want to view, and which positions they want to look at in a data table, as well as an intercorrelation heatmap.

## eda_football

Similar to the eda_basketball app, the eda_football app scrapes data from [pro-football-reference.com](https://www.pro-football-reference.com) and displays running stats of different football players. The end user can select which team(s) and positions they want to view in a a data table and an intercorrelation heatmap.

## sp500_data

This app scrapes wikipedia for the companies in the S&P 500, and allows the end user to filter that list by sector. I added on to this project by allowing the end user to select up to 3 stocks to compare, which then pulls the closing price of those stocks and displays them in a line chart.

## eda_cryptocurrency
This app scrapes data from [CoinMarketCap](http://coinmarketcap.com) and displays information about the cryptocurrencies that the user selects. The user can adjust the currency they're viewing, the cryptocurrencies displayed, the time frame of how much the cryptocurrency has changed, and the whether they'd like the values to be sorted. Improvements over the original project: (1) The bar plot height is updated based on the number of coins selected, and (2) the user can "select all" of the coins, rather than just selecting them one at a time.
